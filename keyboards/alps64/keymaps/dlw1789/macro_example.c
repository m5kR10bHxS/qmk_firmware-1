// Macro Example

/*
You can define up to 32 macros in a keymap.json file ...

If you type in a language other than English, or use a non-QWERTY layout like Colemak, Dvorak, or Workman, you may have set your computer's input language to match this layout.
No, Hands Down is not one of them! lol

Therefore, use the QWERTY layer mapping. Note: if you have your terminal mapped to your DE language, is this still necessary??? If so, what happens when switching back and forth between Workman and Hands Down???
Presumably, you need a different macro for each language, otherwise, QWERTY key mapping should be used for all macros.

The Send Keys function should not be confused with the QMK Macro function.
